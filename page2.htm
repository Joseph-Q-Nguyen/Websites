                        The first console that I ever played on was the <i>Xbox</i>. This is very memorable to me because this was the first time I got to play one of my favorite video games <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i>. I played a lot of <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> because I just loved the plot of the game. I always played the game with my cousin Jason. There were many other great games that I played like <i>Halo 2</i> and <i>Call of Duty: Finest Hour.</i>

                        At the start of middle school year, I met friends that played a lot of Call of Duty on the <i>Play Station 3</i>. I really wanted to play with them so I bought <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i> to play with them. This was the first time I ever tried online gaming and it was really fun. I would play on the PS3 every weekend. Playing the PS3 helped me make a lot of friends, including Darren. I would play a lot of Call of Duty Zombies with him and another guy named Daniel. Middle school was such a fun year for me because at that time, everyone in the school played Call of Duty.
