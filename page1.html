                        Hi my name is Joseph Nguyen. I was born in August 12 in San Jose California and I have lived in San Jose my whole life.  I am 17 years old and I am a senior at Evergreen Valley High School. I have a twin sister named Mary. My favorite thing to do is play video games. I started to play video games when I was really young and I was influenced by my cousin Jason. Jason and I are really close and I still play video games with him. Another cousin that I am really close to is Nelson. I use to play video games on the console a lot but now I have transitioned onto the computer. In the future, I hope to be able to have a job that is related to video games.

                        Life to me means friends and family who you can trust and who trusts you. Life should be something that is joyful. I am pretty much always happy because I always look at the positive things in life. I do have times where I am unhappy but I always get over it. I believe that everyone should be nice to each other. I don't like it when people put others down so I am very nice. I never try to put anyone down because I don't want to make anyone feel bad.
