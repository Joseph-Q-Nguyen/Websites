                        The first console that I ever played on was the Xbox. This is very memorable to me because this was the first time I got to play one of my favorite video games Halo: Combat Evolved. I played a lot of Halo: Combat Evolved because I just loved the plot of the game. I always played the game with my cousin Jason. There were many other great games that I played like Halo 2 and Call of Duty: Finest Hour.

                        At the start of middle school year, I met friends that played a lot of Call of Duty on the Play Station 3. I really wanted to play with them so I bought Call of Duty Black Ops to play with them. This was the first time I ever tried online gaming and it was really fun. I would play on the PS3 every weekend.
