            <h2>Threat Levels</h2>
            <p>
            There are four threat levels in the anime (there are actually 5 in the manga) that show how  dangeroussomething might be. These threat levels also give heroes the choice to either show up or not. If the threat level is low, some of the stronger heroes won't come, but when the threat level is larger, than the stronger heroes must stop it.
